# DeFi Research Space

**Aim:**  
A living, collaborative hub for exploring, tracking, and riffing on every wild twist in DeFi—where trends, tech, and offbeat ideas collide.

**What is this really for?**

- Donno yet kek 😂 I hardly ever know wot I'm doing, but one thing I do know - JUST DO IT, is better than plump sexy ass sitting doing nada

- *Serious stuff*: In-depth analysis and recurring research on L1/L2 trends, DAOs, new protocol upgrades, liquidity adventures, and airdrop playbooks.
- *Prediction markets*: Dedicated space to dissect market creation, odds, governance, and up-and-coming platforms—plus a running log of my own niche market experiments.
- *Cool-headed legends*: If you’re reading this, keep an eye out for people like the haz preaching sei krack & euko pythed daddy magus, so many people I've been blessed to meet & whose knowledge, wisdom, and level-headedness I admire. Th0ts & prayers a guy's gotta dream some 😅 naww seriously, just thinking of you all makes me so happy. (and reinforces the dumbass I am haha)
- *Pricefeeds and Pyth Network*: Special interest in anything pricefeeds, oracle mechanisms, and Pyth Network’s unique approach to community and data. Their vibe is top-tier—you’ll find me referencing, remixing, and celebrating their breakthroughs often!
- *Future plans*: Reviews of tech upgrades (like Fusaka), bridge experiments, composable modules for protocol chaos, memecoin fusions, wild governance hacks, and anything DeFi that’s sufficiently unhinged.
- *Zero-context creativity*: Sometimes, what shows up here will be half-baked, one-off, or batsh*t crazy—because true innovation starts with a little chaos. On those days maybe chat some bera too 🐻

**TL;DR:**  
If it’s DeFi—and it’s new, complex, smart, chaotic, or just plain odd—I’m putting it here. 😎🚀
