# DeFi Research Space

**Aim:**  
A living, collaborative hub for exploring, tracking, and riffing on every wild twist in DeFi—where trends, tech, and offbeat ideas collide.

## What is this really for?

- Donno yet kek 😂 I hardly ever know wot I'm doing, but one thing I do know - JUST DO IT, is better than plump sexy ass sitting doing nada

- **Serious stuff:** In-depth analysis and recurring research on L1/L2 trends, DAOs, new protocol upgrades, liquidity adventures, and airdrop playbooks.
- **Prediction markets:** Dedicated space to dissect market creation, odds, governance, and up-and-coming platforms—plus a running log of my own niche market experiments.
- **Cool-headed legends:** If you’re reading this, keep an eye out for people like the haz preaching sei krack & euko pythed daddy magus, the Beradom Locks mf basement is fun pump it up paw beeple on Berachains...so many people I've been blessed to meet & whose knowledge, wisdom, and level-headedness I admire. Th0ts & prayers a guy's gotta dream some 😅 naww seriously, just thinking of you all makes me so happy. (and reinforces the dumbass I am haha)
- **Pricefeeds and Pyth Network:** Special interest in anything pricefeeds, oracle mechanisms, and Pyth Network’s unique approach to community and data. Their vibe is top-tier—you’ll find me referencing, remixing, and celebrating their breakthroughs often!
- **Future plans:** Reviews of tech upgrades (like Fusaka), bridge experiments, composable modules for protocol chaos, memecoin fusions, wild governance hacks, and anything DeFi that’s sufficiently unhinged.
- **Zero-context creativity:** Sometimes, what shows up here will be half-baked, one-off, or batsh*t crazy—because true innovation starts with a little chaos. On those days maybe chat some bera too 🐻

**TL;DR:**  
If it’s DeFi—and it’s new, complex, smart, chaotic, or just plain odd—I’m putting it here. 😎🚀

## ⚙️ Automation & Agents: Onchain Empowerment

This space goes beyond research—automation is a core theme here.

- **Perplexity AI & Agent Workflows:** Use bots, agents, and auto-updating research pipelines for live DeFi data, price alerting, and tracking trends.
- **Anyone can learn agent workflows—yes, you!** There are guides, templates, and experiment logs for stacking tools (Perplexity, GitHub Actions, custom bots) so you can automate your own trading, research, or voting setup.
- The repo’s very own **GitHub Actions** workflow powers things like “Banana of the Day”—showing that playful automation can make onchain life smoother, weirder, and a lot more fun.
- Fork or clone this project to grow your own stack and be a little more “supernatural” onchain.

## 🧃 Contribute or Lurk

Want to add research, or maybe a new banana fact? Fork away.  
We’re chill. Just:
- Keep it real you weird can't read vibes
- Be provocative and respectful
- Engage others in th0ts™ - ASKING QUESTIONS IS COOL fuck anyone that says otherwise
- If it makes someone say “wtf that’s actually interesting,” it belongs here

## 🌱 Vision

DeFi is full of jargon, noise, and overconfidence.
Here, we do the opposite: curious chaos + collective sense-making.
We question, we joke, we test hypotheses, and maybe learn something by accident.
