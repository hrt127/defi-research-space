  <summary>🤔 What is this really for?</summary>

 **Donno yet kek 😂** 
I hardly ever know wot I'm doing, but one thing I do know - JUST DO IT, is better than plump sexy ass sitting doing nada. so many th0ts and dreams and ideas I wanna give some plump curves real weighty balls. fr tho, probz some of this and some more over time 👇

- **Serious stuff:** In-depth analysis and recurring research on L1/L2 trends, DAOs, new protocol upgrades, liquidity adventures, and airdrop playbooks.
- **Prediction markets:** Dedicated space to dissect market creation, odds, governance, and up-and-coming platforms—plus a running log of my own niche market experiments.
- **Cool-headed legends:** If you’re reading this, keep an eye out for people like the haz preaching sei krack & euko pythed daddy magus, the Beradom Locks mf brr honey axe girthy basement is fun pump it up paw beeple on Berachains...so many people I've been blessed to meet & whose knowledge, wisdom, and level-headedness I admire. Th0ts & prayers a guy's gotta dream some 😅 naww seriously, just thinking of you all makes me so happy. (and reinforces the dumbass I am haha)
- **Pricefeeds and Pyth Network:** Special interest in anything pricefeeds, oracle mechanisms, and Pyth Network’s unique approach to community and data. Their vibe is top-tier—you’ll find me referencing, remixing, and celebrating their breakthroughs often!
- **Future plans:** Reviews of tech upgrades (like Fusaka), bridge experiments, composable modules for protocol chaos, memecoin fusions, wild governance hacks, and anything DeFi that’s sufficiently unhinged.
- **Zero-context creativity:** Sometimes, what shows up here will be half-baked, one-off, or batsh*t crazy—because true innovation starts with a little chaos. On those days maybe chat some bera too 🐻

  - **Perplexity AI & Agent Workflows:** Use bots, agents, and auto-updating research pipelines for live DeFi data, price alerting, and tracking trends.
  - **Anyone can learn agent workflows—yes, you!** There are guides, templates, and experiment logs for stacking tools (Perplexity, GitHub Actions, custom bots) so you can automate your own trading, research, or voting setup.
  - The repo’s very own **GitHub Actions** workflow powers things like “Banana of the Day”—showing that playful automation can make onchain life smoother, weirder, and a lot more fun.
  - Fork or clone this project to grow your own stack and be a little more wear your underpants on the outside onchain.
