# 2025 L2 DeFi Trends and Analysis

## Overhead Summary (2025/2026)

- **Ethereum Layer-1 vs Layer-2:** Major L2s (Arbitrum, Base) see growth in TVL, daily transactions, and DeFi activity. L1 becomes the 'settlement layer' favored for institutional and high-value operations; L2s become the primary home for user-centric DeFi.
- **Metrics & Behavior:** Multi-layered system emerges: rapid launches and incentives on L2s, security and depth on L1. Smaller LPs and builders deploy fast/innovative protocols on L2, while flagship apps keep liquidity on L1.
- **Ecosystem:** Approximately 1/3 of L2 TVL originates from L1, 1/3 is natively minted, and 1/3 from other chains—L2s establish local economies and cross-chain liquidity.
- **Future Outlook:** L2/L1 split will deepen, driven by protocol upgrades (Ethereum Fusaka), wallet/bridge design, and yield-seeking users. Watch out for new liquidity bridges and trading modules designing for composability and cross-rollup operations.

### Is Ethereum’s DeFi Future on L2s? (Source: Coindesk, Sep 2025)

> *Ethereum’s mainnet activity has cooled despite high ether price, but L2s are booming: Arbitrum and Base cross $20B and $15B in Total Value Locked (TVL) respectively.*
>
> - Ethereum L1 fees fell 44% even as L2 transactions skyrocket. Major protocols, from Uniswap to Aave, restructure to leverage both layers.
> - L1 acts as backbone for secure institutional settlement (e.g., BlackRock, Franklin Templeton tokenized funds now live), while L2s offer speed/cost efficiency for DeFi users and builders.
> - Innovation clusters on L2s—cheap transactions and instant confirmations fuel arbitrage, perp futures, and custom modules (like Uniswap V4 “hooks”).
> - Wallets and fiat onramps increasingly direct new users to L2s first.
> - Liquidity flows: Small LPs seek yield on L2, flagship protocols cluster TVL on L1 for scale/security.
> - Cross-chain bridges and L2-native minting create ecosystem synergy.
> - Anticipated Ethereum "Fusaka" upgrade (due Dec 2025) aims at even faster and cheaper mainnet settlements.

## Deep Analysis: L2/L1 Going into 2026

- **Execution vs. Settlement:** Protocols will continue to decouple fast execution (L2) from secure settlement (L1); this will shape user habits and protocol strategies.
- **Innovation Hotspots:** L2s will host rapid DeFi experimentation and composable primitives with low deployment/fork cost. Builders iterate, then “graduate” to L1.
- **Institutionalization:** L1 will remain essential for institutional products and high-value assets (stablecoins, fund tokens, high-liquidity pools).
- **Liquidity Fragmentation:** As liquidity spreads across L2s and chains, new bridging and aggregation infrastructure becomes vital for seamless user experience.
- **Upgrade Watch:** Follow the Fusaka upgrade and related testnets for shifts in cost/model for L1 settlements and new DeFi primitives.
